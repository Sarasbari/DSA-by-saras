This repository contains my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms, with solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode and CodeStudio. I aim to solve 2â€“3 problems daily to build strong problem-solving skills and improve consistency.  Languages used: C++, Java, (depending on the problem).
